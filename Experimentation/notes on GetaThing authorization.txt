Step 1. Direct users to request Thingiverse access

Open a browser (or redirect) to the url specified below.
The user will be prompted to authorize your app for access to their
Thingiverse account.

  GET https://www.thingiverse.com/login/oauth/authorize
Parameters

client_id    - Required string - The client ID you received from
               Thingiverse when you registered.
redirect_uri - Optional string - URL in your app where users
               will be sent after authorization.
               
               
Step 2. Thingiverse redirects back to your site

If the user accepts your request, Thingiverse redirects back to your
site with a temporary code in a code parameter.

From
: perlygatekeeper@/var/log/apache2 [44]; cat access.log | egrep -i 'getathing'

GET /GetaThing?code=581e43e6934d8694c0ba22b638bd196d

Step 3. Exchange code for an access token

Send the code along with your client id and client secret to get an access token that can be used to interact with Thingiverse on the user’s behalf. If your application is web-based make sure you’re doing this from the backend to prevent sharing your secret with the client.

  POST https://www.thingiverse.com/login/oauth/access_token

Parameters

client_id     - Required string - The client ID you received from Thingiverse
                when you registered.
redirect_uri  - Optional string
client_secret - Required string - The client secret you received from Thingiverse
                when you registered.
code          - Required string - The code you received as a response to Step 2.

Response

The response will be in URL encoded form.

  access_token=e72e16c7e42f292c6912e7710c838347ae178b4a&token_type=bearer

WORKS!
