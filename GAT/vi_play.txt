My son's school is going on a field trip to a garden with beehives, so I was
asked to make a simple prop to explain honeycombs to them.

    Turned out to be an interesting subject, so I modeled open and closed cells,
    and a way of specifying the cell thickness so you can put multiple chunks
    together. (In this case the wall thickness of the outer perimeter is half of
    the internal divisions).
