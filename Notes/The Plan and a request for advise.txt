I am making a REST::Client consumer which returns Objects
Many of the objects can be retrieved with the specific ID for that thing
GET('/things/THING_ID')
but will also return a list of things if not given an ID
GET('/things/')
I thought of adding a method, but it would likely need to be a CLASS method
as APP::Thing->new() should require an ID
I could also make a new object, APP::Things which would be an ArrayRef[APP:Thing]
to make it even more complicated, the API provides the following additional calls
to get things ordered a certain way or matching a criteria:
/newest/, /featured/, /popular/, /search/SEARCH_TERM/

Advise, comments or suggestions?
