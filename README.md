Get_A_Thing
===========

Get things from thingiverse.com via there API.

It was taking me quite some time to download all the images, files and instructions for a given thing from thingiverse.
Originally, I was planning on scraping web pages for the information on each thing I wanted to save, but then
a friend mentioned API and I had one of those Duh! moments.  This project will contain a perl module, based on Moose,
which will serve as a Perl interface to thingiverse's API: http://www.thingiverse.com/developers/rest-api-reference.

Thingiverse's documentation page http://www.thingiverse.com/developers/libraries lists examples for Ruby and PHP but not
Perl and my efforts to find an example did not produce one (though that doesn't mean that one does or didn't exist).

This project is just starting and nearly nothing is yet working.  I will add versioning and claim 1.0 once I have 
methods for users and things that pass testing.
